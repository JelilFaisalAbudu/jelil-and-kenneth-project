        <header>Generator methods</header>
        <p>
          Generator methods can be defined using the shorthand syntax as well.
          When doing so: The asterisk (*) in the shorthand syntax must be before
          the generator property name. (That is, * g(){} will work, but g *(){}
          will not.) Non-generator method definitions cannot contain the yield
          keyword. This means that legacy generator functions won't work either,
          and will throw a SyntaxError. Always use yield in conjunction with the
          asterisk (*).

        <header>findIndex()</header>
        <p>
          It does what it says, gives you the index value if the value is
          present in the array and -1 if itâ€™s not present. p>

      <section class="main-section">
        <header>find()</header>
        <p>
          Finding if a particular value exists in a given array is one of the
          most basic operations we will have to perform on an array in almost
          every case. The find method is a very short and sleek method that does
          this for you in JS, avoiding the need to write loops on your own every
          time you want to find something.

      <section class="main-section">
        <header>filter()</header>
        <p>
          It gives you a new array, with all the values from the given array
          that satisfy the given condition or test.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header>includes()</header>
        <p>
          The include method simply returns true or false after checking whether
          the given array contains the provided element or not.
